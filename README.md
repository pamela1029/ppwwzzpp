I picked this question because I find it interesting. On airplanes, trains, trams, or any form of transportation, I personally like to switch seats to be closer to my friends. While many people accept my request, there are some who don’t like the idea. So I was curious about the proportion of people who would find it rude to switch seats. This dataset is interesting because it gives insight into many people's opinions, and sometimes the proportion between “yes” and “no” responses actually surprises me. The chart shows that 74% of people don’t think it’s rude to ask someone to switch seats on a flight to sit closer to friends, while 26% find it somewhat or very rude, with a suggestion to offer compensation (like covering WiFi) to make the request more polite.
